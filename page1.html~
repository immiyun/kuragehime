		 Amamizukan is an apartment building in Tokyo, where the only tenants are otaku women, and where men are forbidden. All tenants of Amamizukan are the same, being mainly fujoshi and NEETs, refering to themselves as the "Amars" (nuns).

		 <p>Amamizukan's surrounding neighborhood is under threat of redevelopment, as opportunists aim to turn the quaint area into a more cosmopolitan region, with many of the buildings being demolished to make room for hotels and shopping centers. </p>
		
		 Although its tenants fear and loathe attractive/fashionable people, Tsukimi Kurashita and the other tenants are helped by Kuranosuke Koibuchi to see the Amamizukan is not destroyed by creating a clothing brand to save up money and buy Amamizukan themselves.

		<div class="bio grid_9" id="Tsukimi"> <span class="title">Tsukimi Kurashita</span><br>
		Tsukimi is an otaku girl who lives in Tokyo and wants to be an illustrator. Influenced by her late mother, she has a love for all kinds of jellyfish and is quite knowledgeable about them. She is the only resident of Amamizukan who knows Kuranosuke's true gender. Like the other Amars, she has a fear of stylish people and will usually petrify in their presence. Tsukimi has a pet spotted jellyfish named Clara. Whenever she gets a make-over from Kuranosuke she becomes beautiful and Shū falls for her. She reciprocates Shū's feelings but she is led to think that he is in love with another person. She is also unaware of Kuranosuke's masculine side when he is dressed in girl's clothing but whenever he "turns" into a boy, she becomes overly conscious of him.
